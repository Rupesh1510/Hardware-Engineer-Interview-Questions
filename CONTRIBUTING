## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo. Comitting directly to `master` is not allowed. To do this, use the Github UI to create a fork (upper right hand corner for web)
2. Make your changes
3. **Please use markdown**, unless you have styling that is absolutely unsupported. In that case, you may consider creating a new folder in the repo with other assets, like images or PDFs.
4. Once you're done, open a pull request from your branch to the master branch of this repo, and get it approved. Once it is approved, someone who is a contributor to the repo will merge it to master.
