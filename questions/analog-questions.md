# Analog Questions

## Transistors

* How does a transistor work and why would you use one in a circuit?
* What is the difference between a BJT and a MOSFET?

## Op-Amps

* What are op-amps and why do we use them?
* Draw an inverting and noninverting op-amp
* Draw a differential op-amp
* What are the assumptions for an ideal op-amp?

## Signal Processing

* Draw a LPF (Low Pass Filter)
* What is a Bode plot and what can it tell us?
* What is the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem?
* What is aliasing?

## Designing circuits

* Explain what parasitic capacitance is and how to handle it. Also understand it in the context of:
  * Where it might occur
  * Why we can't always increase clock speed
* Design a circuit that allows an Arduino to control a 12V RGB LED strip
